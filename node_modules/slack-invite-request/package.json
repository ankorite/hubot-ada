  "readme": "# Slack Invite Request (aka SIR)\n\n![SIR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealklanni/slack-invite-request/master/public/images/bot.png)\n\nFully-customizable webapp for generating invite requests to your private Slack \nteam. Authenticates applicants via Google Sign-In and then displays form details \nsubmitted by the applicant by posting to a group/channel/user of your choice \non Slack. \n\nThe applicant will see the following pages in order:\n\n1. `/` - provides some information about SIR and your Slack team\n2. `/signin` - Google authentication\n3. `/apply` - custom form to gather important details from the user\n4. `/thanks` - thank the user for submitting and what to expect next\n \nSIR makes use of [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templates and \n[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) UI, so it's **mobile-friendly** out of \nthe box and **highly-customizable**. Most static strings can be easily configured \nfrom a [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/start.html) config file, making quick edits a \nbreeze even if you have no web development experience.\n\nDeploying your SIR can be a little more complex, but Heroku takes most of the pain \nout of it. See below for more details.\n\n## Installation\n\nClone the repository to your web server\n\nAlternatively:\n\n* Install via `npm install slack-invite-request`\n* Download the [latest release](https://github.com/therealklanni/slack-invite-request/releases/latest)\n\nThen, configure Nginx/Apache or [deploy to Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction).\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Google Client ID\n\nTo use this app, you will need a Google Developer Client ID. Visit the \n[Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com) to set up a \nnew project.\n\n1. In the Developer Console, click `Add Project` to create a new project.\n2. On the Project Dashboard, click `Enable an API` and turn on `Google+ API`\n3. Click on `Credentials` on the left navigation (under \"APIs and Auth\")\n4. Click on `Create new Client ID` under \"OAuth\"\n5. Choose \"Web application\"\n6. In the \"Authorized JavaScript Origins\" text box, enter your Hubot URL (e.g. http://myserver.com)\n7. In the \"Authorized Redirect URL\" text box, enter \"http://myserver.com/signin\"\n8. Copy the `ClientID` \n\n### Environment variables\n\nThese environment variables are required (with the exception of `SLACK_CHANNEL`) to enable the **Google SignIn** and **Slack** integrations. Make sure to set these before starting your server.\n\n* `GA_TOKEN` - To track analytics on your SIR, create a Google Analytics token (set this to `X` if you don't want analytics)\n* `GOOGLE_CLIENTID` - the Client ID from above\n* `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - obtained by adding a \"Incoming Webhook\" integration to your Slack team\n* `SLACK_CHANNEL` - the destination for the request notifications; this can be a public #channel, private group, or a @username. (optional, for overriding the default channel in the Slack \"Incoming Webhook\" integration settings)\n* `SLACK_BOT_NAME` - override the bot name (default: \"SIR\")\n\ne.g., for Heroku you would run:\n\n```sh\nheroku config:set ENV_VARIABLE=value\n```\n\n### Strings\n\nYou can customize each page by modifying the `strings.yml` file.\n\nThe `strings.yml` file is set up as follows:\n\n```yml\nmain:\n  # ... strings for main and thanks pages ...\napply:\n  # ... strings for application page ...\n  header:\n    # ... strings for the page header ...\n  form:\n    # ... form field configuration ...\nsignin:\n  # ... strings for signin page ...\n```\n\nIn the `apply.form` section, the `fullName` and `email` blocks should be\nconsidered necessary for proper functionality of the app. However, you can\nstill customize these fields by editing these (and only these) properties: \n\n* `class` - classes to apply to this form input (use for CSS customization)\n* `title` - the text that will appear above the input field\n* `required` - set to `true` to make the field a required field (optional)\n* `readonly` - set to `true` to disable changing the value (optional)\n* `help` - additional description (optional)\n\nIn the `apply.form.custom` section, you can modify *any* of the values as you see\nfit, or add/remove blocks, or even remove the `custom` section entirely, if\nyou like.\n\nThe default configuration should sufficiently provide varying examples of custom\nfield configurations. More advanced users can also modify the *view templates* \nthemselves for even higher degree of customization. If you choose to do this,\nplease note that the `fullName` and `email` fields should still be considered \nnecessary.\n\n## Planned\n\n- [ ] Redis (or possibly any other db) support\n- [ ] Support other authentication platforms (OpenID Connect, etc)\n- [ ] Admin page (track who you've already sent and invite to, etc) maybe?\n\n***PRs accepted!***\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [Kevin Lanni](https://github.com/therealklanni)\n",
