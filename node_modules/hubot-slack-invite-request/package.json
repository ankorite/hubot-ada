As of right now, you must specify `git://github.com/therealklanni/hubot.git#18146ab4` as the package version for `hubot` in your `package.json`. This notice will be removed when the changes are merged upstream to hubot core.\n\n---\n\nServes pages from your Hubot which authenticates users via Google Sign-In and \nthen displays a form for requesting an invite to a [Slack](http://slack.com) team.\nWhen the form is submitted, the details are posted to your channel/group on Slack.\n\nThe user will see each page in the following order:\n\n1. login\n2. apply\n3. thanks\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install hubot-slack-invite-request`\n\nThen add `\"hubot-slack-invite-request\"` to `external-scripts.json`\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Google API key\n\nTo use this script, you will need a Google API developer key. Visit the [Google\nDeveloper Console](https://console.developers.google.com) to set up a new project.\n\n1. In the Developer Console, click `Add Project` to create a new project.\n2. On the Porject Dashboard, click `Enable an API` and turn on `Google+ API`\n3. Click on `Credentials` on the left navigation (under \"APIs and Auth\")\n4. Click on `Create new Client ID` under \"OAuth\"\n5. Choose \"Web application\"\n6. In the \"Authorized JavaScript Origins\" text box, enter your Hubot URL (e.g. http://myhubot.com)\n7. In the \"Authorized Redirect URL\" text box, enter \"http://myhubot.com/login\"\n8. Copy the `ClientID` into strings.yml\n\n### Environment variables\n\n* `HUBOT_SLACK_ADMIN_CHANNEL` - the destination for the request notifications from Hubot; this can be a public channel or private group.\n* `HUBOT_BASE_URL` - the base URL for where your hubot lives (e.g. http://myhubot.com/), *please include the trailing slash*\n\nThese should be configured in your hubot initialization script. Or, for example,\non Heroku you would run:\n\n```sh\nheroku config:set ENV_VARIABLE=value\n```\n\n### Strings\n\nYou can customize each page by modifying the `strings.yml` file.\n\nThe `strings.yml` file is set up as follows:\n\n```yml\napply:\n  # ... strings for application page ...\n  header:\n    # ... strings for the page header ...\n  form:\n    # ... form field configuration ...\nthanks:\n  # ... strings for thank you page ...\nlogin:\n  # ... strings for login page ...\n```\n\nIn the `form` section of `apply`, the `fullName` and `email` blocks should be\nconsidered necessary for proper functionality of the script. However, you can\nstill customize these fields by editing these (and only these) properties: \n\n* `class`\n* `title`\n* `required`\n* `readonly`\n* `help` (not provided by default).\n\nIn the `custom` section of `form`, you can modify *any* of the values as you see\nfit, or add/remove blocks, or even remove the `custom` section entirely, if\nyou like.\n\nThe default configuration should sufficiently provide varying examples of custom\nfield configurations. More advanced users can also modify the view templates \nthemselves for even higher degree of customization. If you choose to do this,\nplease note that the `fullName` and `email` should still be considered necessary.\n\n## Commands\n\n*None*\n",
